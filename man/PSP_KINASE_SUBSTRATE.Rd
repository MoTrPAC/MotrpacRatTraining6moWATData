\describe{
  \item{GENE}{character; gene symbol.}
  \item{KINASE}{character; kinase.}
  \item{KIN_ACC_ID}{character; kinase UniProt accession.}
  \item{KIN_ORGANISM}{character; kinase organism. Only "human".}

  \item{SUB_MOD_RSD}{character; modification site (S, T, or Y followed by
  amino acid position.)}
  \item{SITE_GRP_ID}{character; unique identifier for a modification site and
  its homologous sites in all proteoforms and species.}

\details{
The "Kinase_Substrate_Dataset.xlsx" file, downloaded from v6.6.0.4
  of PhosphoSitePlus on 2022-06-05
  (\url{https://www.phosphosite.org/staticDownloads}), was filtered to human
  kinases and substrates. Additionally, instances of auto-phosphorylation
  were removed.
