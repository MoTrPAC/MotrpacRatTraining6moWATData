\title{Metabolomics RefMet chemical subclass FGSEA}
\format{
A named list of 3 \code{data.frame} objects. Similar to what is in
  \code{\link{GO_FGSEA}}.
}
\usage{
METAB_FGSEA
}
\description{
FGSEA of the metabolomics differential analysis results using
  the Metabolomics Workbench RefMet chemical subclasses.
}
\details{
Metabolites were grouped according to their RefMet subclass and
  FGSEA was performed the same as for gene sets. Only those subclasses with
  at least 10 metabolites, after filtering to what was detected in WAT, were
  tested for enrichment.
