var	labelDescription
pid	integer; randomly generated 8-digit identifier used in linkage to phenotypic data. All samples from the same animal have the same PID.
bid	integer; unique 5 digit identifier of all samples collected for an acute test/sample collection period. All samples collected during that period will have the same BID.
labelid	"integer; unique 11 digit specimen label identifier, originating at the collection site, that provides a link to specimen processing and is used for shipments to the biorepository. Same as viallabel only in instances where aliquots are not further processed at the biorepository."
viallabel	character; unique 11 digit sample vial identifier. Starts with the bid.
sex	"factor; the sex of the rat with levels ""Female"" and ""Male""."
timepoint	"factor; exercise training group. Either ""SED"" (sedentary) or the number of weeks of training (""1W"", ""2W"", ""4W"", ""8W"")."
exp_group	factor; experimental group. Unique combination of sex (first letter) and timepoint.
gene_symbol	character; official gene symbol.
entrez_gene	integer; Entrez gene identifier.
site	"character; phosphorylation site(s) extracted from feature_ID column and stripped of trailing lowercase amino acid letters (s, t, y). Multiple sites are separated by semicolons."
human_feature_ID	character; human UniProt accession followed by an underscore and positions of phosphorylation.
human_uniprot	character; human UniProt accession extracted from human_feature_ID column.
human_site	"character; human phosphorylation site(s) extracted from human_feature_ID column and stripped of trailing lowercase amino acid letters (s, t, y). Multiple sites are separated by semicolons."
rin	numeric; RNA integrity number (RIN).
pct_globin	numeric; percent of reads mapping to globin.
pct_umi_dup	numeric; percent of PCR duplicates as quantified with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs).
median_5_3_bias	numeric; median 5'-3' bias.
dataset	character; metabolomics platform in which the feature was measured.
name_in_figures	character; alternative feature identifier primarily used in visualizations.
refmet_super_class	character; RefMet chemical super class.
refmet_main_class	character; RefMet chemical main class.
refmet_sub_class	character; RefMet chemical sub class.
lipid_class	character; (lipids only) the class of the lipid. There are 43 unique classes.
chain_length	integer; (lipids only) total number of carbons that comprise the fatty acid chain.
double_bond	integer; (lipids only) total number of C=C double bonds in the fatty acid chain.
rt	numeric; retention time. Used to assign lipid_class.
mz	numeric; mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).
neutral_mass	numeric; neutral mass (g/mol).
formula	character; chemical formula.
